## What's Google Foobar?

Google Foobar called foo.bar, the system has been used by Google for at least a year and is triggered when a user enters certain search terms relating to coding languages like Python and Java. The search results page breaks open to reveal the message "You're speaking our language. Up for a challenge?" to which the user can decline once, request the message isn't shown again, or click "I want to play".

You get given a time limit for each challenge, ranging from a day to
a few weeks, and your code is run against hidden test cases â€” including
how fast and memory-efficient it is!

I completed this challenge, and have no work left to do on it unless
Google sends me more.
